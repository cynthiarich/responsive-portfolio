                    <p class="quote">Every year, I try to master something completely new.</p>
                    <p>One year, I learned how to ice skate - thankfully, I escaped with no broken bones.</p>
                    <p>Next, it was violin - where I met the world's most patient (and talented) violin teacher.</p>
                    <p>The next year, I tried woodworking - which taught me a new level of patience.</p>
                    <p>This year, I'm learning web development. For those who know me, this seems like less of a stretch. I spend a lot of time around developers in my role as Product Manager of <a href="https://lab.github.com">GitHub Learning Lab</a> and, I've spent a lot of time teaching Git and GitHub over the last 5 years. This isn't completely new to me ... but yet it is.</p>
                    <p>Why do I spend all this time learning random things? Because, what I get from these adventures is more than the thrill of skating on ice --- it is a better understanding of how humans learn. Learning new things keeps me in touch with what it's like to be new at something, and that's a level of empathy none of us can afford to be without.</p>
                    <p>So here I am, learning how to be a full stack developer -- because I want to build cool things -- but also because I believe it will make me a better Product Manager and educator.</p> 
                    <p>This portfolio will be the collecting point for all the fun things I build along the way. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
