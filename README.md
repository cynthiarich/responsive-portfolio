# My Responsive Portfolio

This project is a remix of my original portfolio published at [https://cynthiarich.github.io](https://cynthiarich.github.io). Using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), the portfolio has been redesigned to be responsive for various screen sizes.

Check out the newest version of the portfolio at: [https://cynthiarich.github.io/responsive-portfolio](https://cynthiarich.github.io/responsive-portfolio).
